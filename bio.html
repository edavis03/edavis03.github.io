	<h1> About Emily Davis </h1>

	<p>Emily Davis is a senior at Tufts University majoring in mathematics and minoring in computer science.  She likes spending time with friends, drawing, sleeping, and eating.  But mostly, she likes cats, a trait she inherited from her father.  The first computer program Emily ever wrote told the user how many cats they would own by a given age. (HINT: they program simply multiplied the age by 3). Emily plans to teach middle school math next year, and she also plans to acquire more cats.</p>
