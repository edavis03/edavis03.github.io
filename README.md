In this repository are my html and css files for Assignment 1.  The files create a 
website whose index page consists of my name, my picture, and links to my bio and resume.
My bio and resume are each on their own page.  Each html file has its own 
corresponding css file.

1) To my knowledge, all of the work has been correctly implemented.  I am basing this assessment
off the fact that my webpage fuctions as I would like it to and neither validator site showed 
warnings or errors on any of my files.

2) I discussed this assignment with Jenny Hamilton.

3) I spent approximately 15 hours on this assignment.
